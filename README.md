Fwertz's Vim Files
==================

About
-----

I find myself moving around machines quite frequently so I decided it would be nice to have my own vim configuration and setup accessible wherever I have or could have git.

### Inspiration

A lot of pros and wannabe's like me have been doing this much longer than I. My inspiration and the basis for this setup comes from [Sole's](http://https://github.com/sole/dotvim) setup on GitHub. 

### What's in it
I changed up the vimrc to my needs, but it's def. still growing. I'm still quite a vim newb so as I learn more I'll refine some of the empty and funny-looking details.
